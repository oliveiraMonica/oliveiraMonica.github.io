Exploratory Data Analysis, or EDA for short, is the process of exploring and visualizing data to find useful patterns and insights that help inform the modeling process.
Oftentimes when we're working with classification data, we might have dozens, if not hundreds of potential features at our disposal. <br>
So the process of EDA is largely about identifying which features are most promising and narrowing down to just a handful, at least to start, as we build a baseline model, we can always add more features later.

<br>
When performing EDA for classification, it`s important to explore:
- The target variale
- The features
- Feature-target relationships
- Feature-feature relationships

1 - Defining a target <br>
Defining a target variable for classfication often requires data manipulation:
