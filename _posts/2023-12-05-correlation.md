Exploring your features and your target by themselves is very important to give you a solid understanding of what each variable means, its possible values, and spot any potential data issues with each of our features or our target.
But that process doesn't really go very far in terms of determining which features might be useful in our model.
Which features are going to be the most powerful predictors of our target classes? One very important metric for helping assess that is **correlation**.
